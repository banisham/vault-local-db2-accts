#Add the following line at the end of the file to grant "hcvpwdmanid" the permission to run passwd without a password prompt:

#Configure SSH to allow password authentication globally while only allowing SSH key-based authentication for specific users. Here's how you can achieve this:

# Ensure to put in the Match block below the Subsystem as mentioned below.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Subsystem directive (outside of Match blocks)
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server

# Allow password authentication globally
PasswordAuthentication yes

# Match block to restrict SSH key-based authentication to specific users
Match User hcvpwdmanid
    PasswordAuthentication no


# Copy the public key of hcvpwdmanid to /home/hcvpwdmanid/.ssh/authorized_keys

sudo -u hcvpwdmanid -i

mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

echo "<public-key-of-hcvpwdmanid" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

exit

# Ensure you are as root user.

sudo systemctl restart sshd

sudo systemctl status sshd
